\section{Install lab data}

For the different labs in this course, your instructor has prepared a
set of data (kernel images, kernel configurations, root filesystems
and more). Download and extract its tarball from a terminal:

{\small
\begin{bashinput}
$ cd
$ wget %\sessionurl%/__SESSION_NAME__-labs.tar.xz
$ tar xvf __SESSION_NAME__-labs.tar.xz
\end{bashinput}
}

Lab data are now available in an \code{__SESSION_NAME__-labs} directory in
your home directory. This directory contains directories and files used in
the various practical labs. It will also be used as working space,
in particular to keep generated files separate when needed.
